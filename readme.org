This emacs package implements a local minor mode that highlights occurrences of the current selected region. It uses the built-it =highlight-regexp= function.

* Installation


Add the file =region-occurrences-highlighter= to your =load-path=, require it, and enable it for each buffer with =alt-x= =region-occurences-highlighter-mode=.

You can add a hook to enable it when oppening a buffer, as in the code below.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'region-occurences-highlighter)

(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'region-occurrences-highlighter-mode)
#+end_src

Also, it is available on MELPA, and that is the preferred installation method.


* Customization
These following are available in customize:
- =region-occurrences-highlighter--face=: Face used to highlight the occurrences. Defaults to inverse text.
- =region-occurrences-highlighter--min-size=: Minimum region length to highlight occurrences. Defaults to =3=.
- =region-occurrences-highlighter--max-size=: Maximum region length to highlight occurrences. Defaults to =300=.

* Possible improvements
- A =post-command-hook= is used in order to detect all region changes, including mouse selections. This can lead to performance problems. Another option could be to hook point and mark changes.
- The current behavior mimics other editors like VSCode, where the highlight takes place instantaneously. Some kind of delay could be implemented in order to improve performance
